React Events

Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events.
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.


Adding Events
React events are written in camelCase syntax:

onClick instead of onclick.

React event handlers are written inside curly braces:

onClick={shoot}  instead of onClick="shoot()".


Event handlers

A good practice is to put the event handler as a method in the component
