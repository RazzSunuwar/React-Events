React Events

Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events.
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.


Adding Events
React events are written in camelCase syntax:

onClick instead of onclick.

React event handlers are written inside curly braces:

onClick={shoot}  instead of onClick="shoot()".


Event handlers

A good practice is to put the event handler as a method in the component:


Bind this

For methods in React, the this keyword should represent the component that owns the method.

That is why you should use arrow functions. With arrow functions, this will always represent
the object that defined the arrow function.
